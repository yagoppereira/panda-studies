# 🐼 Pandas Studies – Data Analysis with Python

Welcome to my personal study repository on **Pandas**, the powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis. This project is part of my continuous learning journey in Data Science and was structured with the help of a Trello board to track progress and organize content effectively.

## 📋 Trello Study Board

All tasks, concepts, and exercises were planned using this Trello board:  
🔗 [Pandas Study Board on Trello](https://trello.com/b/6822226ce206ca4bf1137313/panda-exercicio)

The board is divided into the following lists:
- **To Do**: Concepts and tasks planned but not yet started.
- **Doing**: Current topics being explored.
- **Done**: Completed exercises and notes.

## 📁 Contents of This Repository

### 📘 Jupyter Notebook

- [`studies panda python.ipynb`](./studies%20panda%20python.ipynb):  
  This notebook includes a series of practical exercises and notes demonstrating the use of key Pandas features.

### ✅ Topics Covered

The following topics were studied and practiced in the notebook:

- Importing Pandas and loading CSV files
- Exploring datasets with `.head()`, `.tail()`, `.shape`, and `.info()`
- Filtering data using conditional statements
- Selecting rows and columns using `loc` and `iloc`
- Sorting data with `.sort_values()`
- Descriptive statistics using `.describe()` and `.value_counts()`
- Working with missing values: `.isnull()`, `.fillna()`, `.dropna()`
- Grouping and aggregating data with `.groupby()`
- Merging and concatenating DataFrames
- Saving cleaned data back to CSV

Each section includes annotated code, outputs, and small challenges to reinforce learning.
